Progress Report

Boris Mottet and Antoine Demont

We started to implement the environment. We would like to include the position of the darts on the board as an effect on the accuracy for following darts. 

As the environment is not complete, we didn't start implementing the algorithm but we are exploring some options. Should the reward be continuous (the number of points scored by a throw) or sparse (did we win or not) ? This could encourage the agent to better setup for the end game. Indeed, it is better to start a turn with a score of 16 than a score of 17 because the winning throw must be on a double or triple area and we would like the agent to consider such positionning.
